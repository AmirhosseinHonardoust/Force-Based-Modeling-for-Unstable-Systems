# Force-Based-Modeling-for-Unstable-Systems
This article argues that feature-based machine learning breaks down in unstable systems and introduces force-based modeling as a superior abstraction. By focusing on directional pressures, equilibrium, and system dynamics, it shows why forces explain behavior, enable scenarios, and outperform static features in volatile environments.
